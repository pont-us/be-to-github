# be-to-github: convert Bugs Everywhere bugs to GitHub issues

Note: be-to-github is currently in a pre-alpha (proof of concept) state.

`be-to-github` is a utility to extract issues from a
https://bugseverywhere.org/[Bugs Everywhere] database and recreate them as
GitHub Issues using GitHub's GraphQL API.

The utility consists of two scripts: `be-to-xml.py`, which produces an XML
dump from a Bugs Everywhere database, and `xml-to-github.py` which uses the
XML dump to create corresponding GitHub issues for a specified repository.

`be-to-xml.py` requires an install of Bugs Everywhere, which only runs on
Python 2.

`xml-to-github.py` requires Beautiful Soup 4 and Python >=3.7.
